# Modularizing icechunk-python's namespace structure

## Problem

The top-level python namespace `icechunk` is really polluted, which makes it harder to navigate the library. There's [~80 things](https://github.com/earth-mover/icechunk/blob/main/icechunk-python/python/icechunk/__init__.py) in it. For example, both the ubiquitous class `Repository` and the extremely niche class `ManifestSplitDimCondition` are in the top-level `icechunk` namespace.

## Solution

It would be better practice to split this up into sub-modules. That would improve the user experience in a few ways:

- auto-complete would be more helpful
- the API docs would be easier to navigate (see also [#1095](https://github.com/earth-mover/icechunk/issues/1095))
- the key classes would be the only ones in the top-level namespace (e.g. `Repo`, `Session`, `IcechunkStore`), making it more immediately obvious how icechunk is structured
- the words "store"/"storage" would become a bit less overloaded (e.g. `icechunk.Storage`, `icechunk.s3_store`, and `icechunk.IcechunkStore` are all currently in the same namespace, but mean totally different things)

## Options for namespace groupings

1. **Group by related functionality**

I.e. everything related to storage together, everything related to virtual chunks together...

2. **Group by cloud provider / storage type**

I.e. everything for Azure together, everything for GCS together...

Are there any others?

## User experience for icechunk beginners

We don't want it to be too hard for beginners to find the imports they need to get started. There is therefore a tension between strict modularization and initial ease-of-use.

## Specific proposal with rationale

Here's a specific proposal. The rationale is that opening or creating should be top-level, but otherwise everything else should be in specific modules.

Some opinionated notes about the rationale used:
- This proposal is aggressive: it reduces the number of things in the top-level namespace from 78 to 5.
- This proposal chooses to group by related functionality.
- The location of classes that are only really returned to the user, and rarely directly called by the user (e.g. `Diff`), doesn't really matter.
  - Similarly classes with no constructor methods (e.g. `Session`) don't need to be in the top-level namespace.
- Modules with only one member are fine if they add clarity.
- Adding an extra intermediate namespace doesn't make things much harder for users to find. In other words this:

```python
import icechunk
storage = icechunk.s3_storage(bucket="my-bucket", prefix="my-prefix", from_env=True)
repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
```

is not significantly easier than this:

```python
import icechunk
storage = icechunk.storage.s3_storage(bucket="my-bucket", prefix="my-prefix", from_env=True)
repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
```

Also note that this is already valid API:

```python
import icechunk
storage = icechunk.Storage.s3_storage(bucket="my-bucket", prefix="my-prefix", from_env=True)
repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
```

### Top-level `icechunk` module:

- `icechunk.Repository` (also available in `icechunk.repository.Repository`)
- `icechunk.spec_version`
- `icechunk.print_debug_info`
- `icechunk.__version__`

### Sub-modules

Existing namespaces, with new members added:

- `credentials`
  - `credentials.Credentials`
  - `credentials.azure_credentials`
  - `credentials.azure_from_env_credentials`

  - `virtual.VirtualChunkSpec`

## Outstanding questions

- It's generally a bit confusing that there are multiple ways to make most classes, e.g. `local_filesystem_store` and `Storage.new_local_filesystem`. Do we really need both?
  - If we only kept `Storage` we could get rid of a _lot_ of functions in favour of methods...
  - Alternatively should base classes that aren't really meant to be called by the user (e.g. `Storage`) be public API at all?
- What's the difference between `storage.local_filesystem_storage` and `storage.local_filesystem_store`?
  - Similarly how can we better disambiguate `storage.s3_storage` and `storage.s3_store`?
- Is there a similar question for credentials?
- Should cloud-provider-specific classes be further grouped together within `.storage`/`.credentials`?
- Should all configs live together?
  - Should `StorageSettings` really be a `StorageConfig`? Should it live with configs or in `storage`?
  - Similarly should `S3Options` really be `S3Config`?
- Should summary dataclasses such as `Diff` and `GCSummary` live in the top-level?
- Is `distributed` meant to be a public module at all? Why is it's API defined in a different place? Should it be merged with `dask`?
- Union types like `AnyCredential` are re-exported as top-level API for importing, but it seems like they are only useful for internal type-hinting purposes?

## Implementation steps (including deprecation cycle)

We need to implement this in multiple steps, including a deprecation cycle which maintains backwards-compatibility until the cycle is complete.

1. **Decide on public API structure (i.e. review then merge this design doc)**

2. **Move everything into desired locations whilst keeping all top-level imports**

We should add tests that both import paths work.

3. **Change how docs render to display using fine-grained namespaces instead of single top-level namespace**

We can probably configure the API docs to display the submodules first and ignore the top-level imports, even whilst the top-level imports are still available.

4. **Add deprecation warning pointing users to specific fine-grained import**

User experience should look like this:

```python
# works, but emits a warning
from icechunk import ManifestSplitDimCondition
```
```
DeprecationWarning: Importing class ``ManifestSplitDimCondition`` via top-level ``icechunk`` namespace is deprecated. Instead of importing as ``from icechunk import ManifestSplitDimCondition``, please import from the ``manifests`` module from now on, e.g. ``from icechunk.manifests import ManifestSplitDimCondition``.
```
```python
# user changes code to this - now doesn't emit a warning
from icechunk.manifests import ManifestSplitDimCondition
```

While doing this we should also add deprecation warnings to any other API we decide we don't need.

5. **Eventually actually remove top-level import in favour of specific fine-grained import.**

We could potentially even capture and re-emit a `ModuleNotFoundError` with a note that points to the new location.
