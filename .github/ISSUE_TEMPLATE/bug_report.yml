        Minimal, self-contained copy-pastable example that demonstrates the issue.

        Consider listing additional or specific dependencies in [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#example)
        so that calling `uv run issue.py` shows the issue when copied into `issue.py`.

        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for markdown backticks.
