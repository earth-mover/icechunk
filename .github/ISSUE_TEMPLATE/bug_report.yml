        You must list dependencies in [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#example).
        When put in a file named `issue.py` calling `uv run issue.py` should show the issue.

      options:
        - label: Minimal example — the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.
        - label: Complete example — the example is self-contained, including all data and the text of any traceback.
        - label: Verifiable example — the example runs when copied & pasted into an fresh python environment.
        - label: New issue — a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.
