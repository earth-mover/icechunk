# Performance

!!! info

    This is advanced material, and you will need it only if you have arrays with more than a million chunks.
    Icechunk aims to provide an excellent experience out of the box.

Coming Soon.

## Splitting manifests

Icechunk stores chunk references in a chunk manifest file stored in `manifests/`.
For very large arrays (millions of chunks), these files can get quite large.
By default, Icechunk stores all chunk references in a single manifest file per array.
Requesting even a single chunk requires downloading the entire manifest.
In some cases, this can result in a slow time-to-first-byte or large memory usage.

!!! note

    Note that the chunk sizes in the following examples are tiny for demonstration purposes.

To avoid that, Icechunk lets you split the manifest files by specifying a ``ManifestSplittingConfig``.

```python exec="on" session="perf" source="material-block"
import icechunk as ic
from icechunk import ManifestSplitCondition, ManifestSplittingConfig, ManifestSplitDimCondition

split_config = ManifestSplittingConfig.from_dict(
    {
        ManifestSplitCondition.AnyArray(): {
            ManifestSplitDimCondition.DimensionName("time"): 365 * 24
        }
    }
)
repo_config = ic.RepositoryConfig(manifest=ic.ManifestConfig(splitting=split_config))
```

Then pass the config to `Repository.open` or `Repository.create`
```python
repo = ic.Repository.open(..., config=repo_config)
```

This particular example splits manifests so that each manifest contains `365 * 24` chunks along the time dimension, and every chunk along every other dimension in a single file.

Options for specifying the arrays whose manifest you want to split are:

1. [`ManifestSplitCondition.name_matches`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitCondition.name_matches) takes a regular expression used to match an array's name;
2. [`ManifestSplitCondition.path_matches`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitCondition.path_matches) takes a regular expression used to match an array's path;
3. [`ManifestSplitCondition.and_conditions`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitCondition.and_conditions) to combine (1), (2), and (4) together; and
4. [`ManifestSplitCondition.or_conditions`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitCondition.or_conditions) to combine (1), (2), and (3) together.


`And` and `Or` may be used to combine multiple path and/or name matches. For example,
```python exec="on" session="perf" source="material-block"
array_condition = ManifestSplitCondition.or_conditions(
    [
        ManifestSplitCondition.name_matches("temperature"),
        ManifestSplitCondition.name_matches("salinity"),
    ]
)
sconfig = ManifestSplittingConfig.from_dict(
    {array_condition: {ManifestSplitDimCondition.DimensionName("longitude"): 3}}
)
```

Options for specifying how to split along a specific axis or dimension are:

1. [`ManifestSplitDimCondition.Axis`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitDimCondition.Axis) takes an integer axis;
2. [`ManifestSplitDimCondition.DimensionName`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitDimCondition.DimensionName) takes a regular expression used to match the dimension names of the array;
3. [`ManifestSplitDimCondition.Any`](./reference.md#icechunk.ManifestSplitDimCondition.Any) matches any _remaining_ dimension name or axis.


For example, for an array with dimensions `time, latitude, longitude`, the following config
```python exec="on" session="perf" source="material-block"
from icechunk import ManifestSplitDimCondition

{
    ManifestSplitDimCondition.DimensionName("longitude"): 3,
    ManifestSplitDimCondition.Axis(1): 2,
    ManifestSplitDimCondition.Any(): 1,
}
```
will result in splitting manifests so that each manifest contains (3 longitude chunks x 2 latitude chunks x 1 time chunk) = 6 chunks per manifest file.


!!! note

    Python dictionaries preserve insertion order, so the first condition encountered takes priority.
