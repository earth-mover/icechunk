# Quickstart

Icechunk is designed to be mostly in the background.
As a Python user, you'll mostly be interacting with Zarr.
If you're not familiar with Zarr, you may want to start with the [Zarr Tutorial](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)

## Installation

Icechunk can be installed using pip or conda:

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    python -m pip install icechunk
    ```

=== "conda"

    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge icechunk
    ```

!!! note

    Icechunk is currently designed to support the [Zarr V3 Specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/v3.0.html).
    Using it today requires installing Zarr Python 3.

## Create a new Icechunk repository

To get started, let's create a new Icechunk repository.
We recommend creating your repo on a cloud storage platform to get the most out of Icechunk's cloud-native design.
However, you can also create a repo on your local filesystem.

=== "S3 Storage"

    ```python
    import icechunk
    storage = icechunk.s3_storage(bucket="my-bucket", prefix="my-prefix", from_env=True)
    repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
    ```

=== "Google Cloud Storage"

    ```python
    import icechunk
    storage = icechunk.gcs_storage(bucket="my-bucket", prefix="my-prefix", from_env=True)
    repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
    ```

=== "Azure Blob Storage"

    ```python
    import icechunk
    storage = icechunk.azure_storage(container="my-container", prefix="my-prefix", from_env=True)
    repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
    ```

=== "Local Storage"

    ```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
    import icechunk
    import tempfile
    storage = icechunk.local_filesystem_storage(tempfile.TemporaryDirectory().name)
    repo = icechunk.Repository.create(storage)
    ```

## Accessing the Icechunk store

Once the repository is created, we can use `Session`s to read and write data. Since there is no data in the repository yet,
let's create a writable session on the default `main` branch.

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
session = repo.writable_session("main")
```

Now that we have a session, we can access the `IcechunkStore` from it to interact with the underlying data using `zarr`:

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
store = session.store  # A zarr store
```

## Write some data and commit

We can now use our Icechunk `store` with Zarr.
Let's first create a group and an array within it.

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
import zarr
group = zarr.group(store)
array = group.create("my_array", shape=10, dtype='int32', chunks=(5,))
```

Now let's write some data

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
array[:] = 1
```

Now let's commit our update using the session

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block" result="code"
snapshot_id_1 = session.commit("first commit")
print(snapshot_id_1)
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You just made your first Icechunk snapshot.

!!! note

    Once a writable `Session` has been successfully committed to, it becomes read only to ensure that all writing is done explicitly.

## Make a second commit

At this point, we have already committed using our session, so we need to get a new session and store to make more changes.

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
session_2 = repo.writable_session("main")
store_2 = session_2.store
group = zarr.open_group(store_2)
array = group["my_array"]
```

Let's now put some new data into our array, overwriting the first five elements.

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
array[:5] = 2
```

...and commit the changes

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
snapshot_id_2 = session_2.commit("overwrite some values")
```

## Explore version history

We can see the full version history of our repo:

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block" result="code"
hist = repo.ancestry(snapshot_id=snapshot_id_2)
for ancestor in hist:
    print(ancestor.id, ancestor.message, ancestor.written_at)
```

...and we can go back in time to the earlier version.

```python exec="on" session="quickstart" source="material-block"
# latest version
assert array[0] == 2
# check out earlier snapshot
earlier_session = repo.readonly_session(snapshot_id=snapshot_id_1)
store = earlier_session.store

# get the array
group = zarr.open_group(store, mode="r")
array = group["my_array"]

# verify data matches first version
assert array[0] == 1
```
