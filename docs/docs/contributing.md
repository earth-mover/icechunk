## Development

### Python Development Workflow

The Python code is developed in the `icechunk-python` subdirectory. To make changes first enter that directory:

```bash
cd icechunk-python
```

Create / activate a virtual environment:

=== "Venv"

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== "Conda / Mamba"

    ```bash
    mamba create -n icechunk python=3.12 rust zarr
    mamba activate icechunk
    ```

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```


Install `maturin`:

=== "Venv"

    ```bash
    pip install maturin
    ```

    Build the project in dev mode:

    ```bash
    maturin develop

    # or with the optional dependencies
    maturin develop --extras=test,benchmark
    ```

    or build the project in editable mode:

    ```bash
    pip install -e icechunk@.
    ```

=== "uv"

    uv manages rebuilding as needed, so it will run the Maturin build when using `uv run`.

    To explicitly use Maturin, install it globally.

    ```bash
    uv tool install maturin
    ```

    Maturin may need to know it should work with uv, so add `--uv` to the CLI.

    ```bash
    maturin develop --uv --extras=test,benchmark
    ```



#### Testing

The full Python test suite depends on S3 and Azure compatible object stores.

They can be run from the root of the repo with `docker compose up` (`ctrl-c` then `docker compose down` once done to clean up.).

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv run pytest
    ```


### Rust Development Workflow

#### Prerequisites

Install the `just` command runner (used for build tasks and pre-commit hooks):

```bash
cargo install just
```

Or using other package managers:
- **macOS**: `brew install just`
- **Ubuntu**: `snap install --edge --classic just`

#### Building

Build the Rust workspace:

```bash
# Build all packages
just build

# Build release version
just build-release

# Compile tests without running them
just compile-tests
```

#### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run tests with logs enabled
just test-logs debug

# Run only specific tests
cargo test test_name
```

#### Code Quality

We use a tiered pre-commit system for fast development:

```bash
# Fast checks (~3 seconds) - format and lint only
just pre-commit-fast

# Medium checks (~2-3 minutes) - includes compilation and deps
just pre-commit

# Full CI checks (~5+ minutes) - includes all tests and examples
just pre-commit-ci
```

Individual checks:

```bash
# Format code
just format

# Check formatting without changing files
just format --check

# Lint with clippy
just lint

# Check dependencies for security issues
just check-deps
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run checks. Install it:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit configuration automatically runs:
- **Every commit**: Fast Python and Rust checks (~2 seconds total)
- **Before push**: Medium Rust checks (compilation + dependencies)
- **Manual**: Full CI-level checks when needed

To run manually:

```bash
# Run on changed files only
pre-commit run

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run full CI checks manually
pre-commit run rust-pre-commit-ci --hook-stage manual
```

## Roadmap

### Features

- Support more object stores and more of their custom features
- Better Python API and helper functions
- Bindings to other languages: C, Wasm
- Better, faster, more secure distributed sessions
- Savepoints and persistent sessions
- Chunk and repo level statistics and metrics
- More powerful conflict detection and resolution
- Efficient move operation
- Telemetry
- Zarr-less usage from Python and other languages
- Better documentation and examples

### Performance

- Lower changeset memory footprint
- Optimize virtual dataset prefixes
- Bring back manifest joining for small arrays
- Improve performance of `ancestry`, `garbage_collect`, `get_size` and other metrics
- More flexible caching hierarchy
- Better I/O pipeline
- Better GIL management
- Request batching and splitting
- Bringing parts of the codec pipeline to the Rust side
- Chunk compaction

### Zarr-related

Weâ€™re very excited about a number of extensions to Zarr that would work great with Icechunk.

- [Variable length chunks](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0003.html)
- [Chunk-level statistics](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0005.html)
