# Icechunk Rust

The Icechunk rust library is used internally by Icechunk Python.
It is currently not designed to be used in standalone form.

- [Icechunk Rust Documentatio](https://docs.rs/icechunk/latest/icechunk/) at docs.rs

We welcome contributors interested in implementing more Rust functionality!
In particular, we would love to integrate Icechunk with [zarrs](https://docs.rs/zarrs/latest/zarrs/),
a new Zarr Rust library.
