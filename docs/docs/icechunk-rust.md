# Icechunk Rust

The Icechunk rust library is used internally by Icechunk Python.
It is currently not designed to be used in standalone form.

We welcome contributors interested in implementing more Rust functionality!
In particular, we would love to integrate Icechunk with [zarrs](https://docs.rs/zarrs/latest/zarrs/),
a new Zarr Rust library.
